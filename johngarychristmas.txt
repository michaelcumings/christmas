John Gary was an unfamiliar face and voice to me outside of this Christmas album, and I inherited it from my grandmother. A bit of internet searching reveals that he was a prolific B-list celebrity of the age, releasing tons of albums, appearing on variety shows, and even hosting one on network television for a season.  RealGoneMusic, in its CD reissue of this 1964 record, claims the album "went to #3 the year it came out and hit the Christmas charts for four straight years after that."  In research for this review, I have found comments across the internet and YouTube in particular uniformly praising John Gary.  Many people find emotional resonance with his style of singing, and cite him as a master of his craft and a natural talent (his 3 1/2 octave range is frequently mentioned). So when you read what I have to say about this album, listen for yourself and bear in mind that many many people (especially in the past) love John Gary's voice, singing style, and this album in particular.  I am not one of those people.

Danny Kaye was a frequent collaborator with John Gary, with John Gary playing the straight man for Kaye's more playful performing style, and the sound of this album seems like someone approaching the form of the prototypical Christmas Album circa 1964 without the special, individual elements to set it apart and make it fun.  The arrangements of the songs do not call attention to themselves, and Gary's voice itself seems content with a workmanlike "perfection".  Every opportunity to show off vocally is not taken.  At each point near the end of a song where you expect the singer to reach for the stratosphere, Gary backs off.
